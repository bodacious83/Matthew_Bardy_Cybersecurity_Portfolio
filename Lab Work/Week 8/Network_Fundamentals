Network Fundamentals Activity

Phase 1- “I’d like to teach the world to ping”

I used: fping -g [IP Address]
All IP Addresses that I ran against the fping were closed, except for 167.172.144.11
The OSI Layer is the 3rd Layer, the Network layer

Phase 2 “Some Syn for Nothin’”

There were 995 closed ports for the nmap scan and 5 open ports.
The five open ports are as follows: 
22/tcp		open		ssh
25/tcp		filtered		smtp
135/tcp 	filtered  	msrpc
139/tcp 	filtered  	netbios-ssn
45/tcp 		filtered	  	microsoft-ds

The OSI Layer that these syn scans are done on is the 4th layer which is the Transport layer.


Phase 3 “ I feel a DNS Change coming on”

I used ssh to 167.172.144.11 on Port 22. 
Then I located the config file under /etc/hosts. 
Within that file, I was able to uncover the IP Address of 98.137.246.8 for the rollingstone.com IP Address.  
Then I ran NSLookup on the IP address and found it was Yahoo.com. After that I ran an NSlookup for rollingstone.com I got the following IP addresses:
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.128.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.192.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.64.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.0.69

The OSI Layers for this Phase are Layer 3 and Layer 6 which are the Network and Presentation Layers.


Phase 4 “Sh Arp Dressed Man”

Using the secret logs pcap file I was able to upload the file into Wireshark.  
Then applied a filter for HTTP and was underwhelmed by the results. Not finding anything suspicious I reached out to Rex and he mentioned using the ARP filter. After using ARP filter, I noticed multiple request from one IP Address over a brief time period. Perhaps it was a script kitty or hacker doing a Ping or an Nmap to find out IP Addresses?

OSI Layer for this is the 7th layer or the Application layer.
