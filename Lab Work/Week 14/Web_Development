-X
Which curl option is used to set request headers?
-h
Which curl option is used to view the response header?
-i
Which request method might an attacker use to scope out usable HTTP requests that an HTTP server will accept?
Smuggling attack?
Sessions and Cookies
Recall that HTTP servers need ways to recognize clients from one another. These are implemented through sessions and cookies.
Answer the following questions about sessions and cookies.
Which response header sends a cookie to the client?

 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: cart=Bob
Set-Cookie
Which request header sets a cookie in the client?

 GET /cart HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
Cookie: cart=Bob
cart=Bob

Monoliths and Microservices
Answer the following questions about monoliths and microservices:
What are the individual components of microservices called?
Services
What is a service that writes to a database and communicates to other services?
Product API 
What type of underlying technology allows for microservices to become scalable and have redundancy? 
Load Balancer
Container Vulnerability Filtering
Answer the following questions about vulnerability filtering Trivy scans with jq:
Do microservices share the same kind of vulnerabilities as regular operating systems?
No?
Would an organization be more concerned with Low severity vulnerabilities as much as Critical?
This question doesnâ€™t make sense to me. I would hope their priority would be on critical vulnerabilities.
Would the bash tool jq be useful in finding certain kinds of vulnerabilities within a vulnerability report?
Yes, would be great for parsing JSON data in Bash.
Deploying and Testing a Container Set
Answer the following questions about multi-container deployment:
What is a tool that can be used to deploy multiple containers at once?
Docker Compose
What kind of file format was required for us to deploy a container set?
YAML
Container Runtime Intrusion Detection Systems
What is a tool used to actively detect intrusion behavior within containers?
IDS or IDP would be used to prevent intrusion. 
What high-value system file might an intruder view that would trigger a sensitive file opening alert?
Config file
What kind of intruder action might trigger an alert from a container IDS that says shell configuration file has been modified?
If the attacker pulls a docker image it will set off several alerts saying the shell configuration file has been modified.
